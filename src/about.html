        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <p>This project was born out of a lifelong interest in <em>Jeopardy!</em> and trivia. My first attempt at scraping data from <em>J! Archive</em> was for a Discord bot I created called <a href="https://github.com/hmltnbrn/trebot" target="_blank">Trebot</a>. This bot allowed users to call for a random question and keep score over a period of time. It was during the making of this that I developed the first script for collecting data from the site and putting it into a database (MongoDB in this case). It only made use of the information on the site about clues for each game.</p>
        <p>In the winter of 2018, I developed the idea for using a modified version of this script to collect the rest of the data, including contestant information and more detailed data on the clues.</p>
