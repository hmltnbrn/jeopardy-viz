        <h2>Collecting the Data</h2>
        <p>In order to build the database, I used <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/" target="_blank">Python 3</a> and <a href="https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/" target="_blank">BeautifulSoup</a> to scrape <a href="http://j-archive.com/" target="_blank">J! Archive</a> of the revelant data. The full GitHub repository for this is <a href="https://github.com/hmltnbrn/jeopardy-scrape" target="_blank">here</a> and the scraping scripts are <a href="https://github.com/hmltnbrn/jeopardy-scrape/tree/master/scrape" target="_blank">here</a>. If you clone the repository, you can learn how to run the script yourself by running the commands below.</p>
        <div class="code">
          <code>cd scrape</code>
          <code>python scrape.py --help</code>
        </div>
        <p>Before running the script above, you will need to have set up your own database. The database itself is relational, allowing for the different tables to be connected through foreign keys. You can create your own database by installing <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/" target="_blank">PostgreSQL</a> and running the SQL code in <a href="https://github.com/hmltnbrn/jeopardy-scrape/tree/master/database" target="_blank">database/create.sql</a> once you have created a database. Below is an entiy-relationship diagram that details the columns and illustrates the connection between the tables.</p>
        <img src="./images/er-diagram.png"/>
        <p>I used the information on each contestant to classify them by a male/female gender. While reductive, it would help in doing further analysis of the data. Run the commands below to send the first name for each contestant to <a href="https://genderize.io/" target="_blank">Genderize.io</a>, a third-party API for identifying gender by name, and update the database accordingly.</p>
        <div class="code">
          <code>cd addon</code>
          <code>python gender.py</code>
        </div>
      </section>

        <h2>Topic Modeling</h2>
        <p>With the data in the database, I went about using <a href="http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/" target="_blank">MALLET</a> to create a topic model for the clues. This will return a set of topics (the number of which you choose--I went with 25) categorizing each input text. I created a series of Pythons scripts for this, keeping them in the <a href="https://github.com/hmltnbrn/jeopardy-scrape/tree/master/topics" target="_blank">topics</a> directory of the project. Run the command below to create a separate text file for each clue in the database from the first specified season to the last.</p>
        <div class="code">
          <code>cd topics</code>
          <code>python create_clues_data.py -s 1 35</code>
        </div>
        <p>Move to the MALLET directory and import these files (specifically, point to the directory they are kept in).</p>
        <div class="code">
          <code>bin\mallet import-dir --input {wherever the project lives}\jeopardy-scrape\topics\mallet_files\data\clues --output jeopardy_clues.mallet --keep-sequence --remove-stopwords</code>
        </div>
        <p>Train the model and create the output files.</p>
        <div class="code">
          <code>bin\mallet train-topics  --input jeopardy_prof.mallet --num-topics 25 --optimize-interval 20 --output-state jeopardy_prof_topic-state.gz --output-topic-keys jeopardy_prof_keys.txt --output-doc-topics jeopardy_prof_composition.txt</code>
        </div>
        <p>Move <strong>jeopardy_prof_keys.txt</strong> and <strong>jeopardy_prof_composition.txt</strong> to <strong>topics/mallet_files/output/clues</strong>. These files contain the topic information and which topics each clue is part of. Run the two commands below to update the database with that data.</p>
        <div class="code">
          <code>cd topics</code>
          <code>python parse_clue_topic_keys.py</code>
          <code>python parse_clue_topic_composition.py</code>
        </div>
        <p>Each run of the topic modeling will create slightly different outputs. It took trial and error for me to decide on using 25 topics. The table below shows the output for the model and the short titles I came up with.</p>

        <p>I created the database tables and scripts for doing a topic model for the professions of each contestant, but as of right now, I could not find the right number of topics to use. It seemed that the run through of the algorithm either created too many duplicates or missed important ones--as in, there was too much variation between the runs. I am going to continue with this after the completion of the project.</p>
