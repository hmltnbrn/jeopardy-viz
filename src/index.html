        <h2>State-by-State Contestants</h2>
        <p>While looking at the data I collected from the archive, I noticed that most contestants were identified by their name, hometown, and profession. I stripped out their local town and isolated each one that was from the fifty U.S. states and the District of Columbia. From here, I took a count of how many came from each state, making sure to only count each contestant once.</p>
        <p>After I had this list, I compared it to <a href="https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-kits/2019/national-state-estimates.html" target="_blank">population estimates made by the U.S. Census Bureau for 2019</a>, creating a proportion of number of contestants to the total population. Below, I created a map of the United States and the District of Columbia, shading each state by the size of the proportion; the darker shade, the larger the proportion, and vice versa. Hover over each state to see more detailed information.</p>
