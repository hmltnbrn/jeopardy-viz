        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>This project is an analysis of a dataset I created by scraping the HTML from the crowdsourced <em>Jeopardy!</em> archive <a href="http://j-archive.com/" target="_blank">J! Archive</a>. Read more about the impetus to this project on the <a href="/about">About</a> page and the methods I took for building the dataset, analyzing it, and visualizing it on the <a href="/methods">Methods</a> page.</p>

        <h2>Topic Modeling</h2>
        <p>Using MALLET, I built a topic model for the clues on J! Archive. Below is a visual representation of the change in topic usage over the course of the show's run. My hope from this is to see trends in topic usage. For example, I noticed that "History/War" spikes to its highest usage during the Gulf War.</p>
        <p>Hover over the line on the graph or the topic key in the legend to isolate each individual topic for viewing. You can also click on the line or legend text to hold it in place.</p>

        <h2>State-by-State Contestants</h2>
        <p>While looking at the data I collected from the archive, I noticed that most contestants were identified by their name, hometown, and profession. I stripped out their local town and isolated each one that was from the fifty U.S. states and the District of Columbia. From here, I took a count of how many came from each state, making sure to only count each contestant once.</p>
        <p>After I had this list, I compared it to <a href="https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-kits/2019/national-state-estimates.html" target="_blank">population estimates made by the U.S. Census Bureau for 2019</a>, creating a proportion of number of contestants to the total population. Below, I created a map of the United States and the District of Columbia, shading each state by the size of the proportion; the darker shade, the larger the proportion, and vice versa. Hover over each state to see more detailed information.</p>

        <h2>Gender in <em>Jeopardy!</em></h2>
        <p>Past studies of gender in <em>Jeopardy!</em> has taken a few different forms over the years. They have either looked at the different kinds of topics men and women may have chosen to respond to or how they act during the game. While J! Archive does not include a reference to a contestant's gender in their description, I was able to use the third-party API <a href="https://genderize.io/" target="_blank">Genderize.io</a> to determine the most likely gender from their first name.</p>

              <h3>Gender By Series</h3>
              <p>Before looking at more in depth analysis of gender in <em>Jeopardy!</em>, it's important to know how many men and women have actually been on the show. I grouped together contestants by their gender (removing any that Genderize.io was not able to determine) and took a count of each. Below is a donut chart of those numbers, indicating that 42.5% of contestants are women and 57.5% are men. These numbers line up almost exactly with studies that used a small number of episodes to conduct their research.</p>

              <h3>Gender By Episode</h3>
              <p>During an actual episode of <em>Jeopardy!</em>, there are three contestants competing against each other. One of them is the winner from the previous episode (if there was one) and the other two are new contestants. I was able to determine the breakdown of those three contestants by gender, only including episodes where all three contestants had a known gender. A makeup of two men and one woman takes up the majority of episodes, with all three being women happening the least. Below is a donut chart showing the breakdown.</p>

              <h3>Who Wins?</h3>
              <p>By the end of an episode, the contestant with the most money is declared the winner. They are allowed to come back to the next game and defend their win. Some are good enough to win multiple games and continue on and on until they lose. I grouped together the data in a way that shows the gender disparity in number of wins. The vast majority of contestants have only one win and I wanted to show this versus those who win more than once.</p>
